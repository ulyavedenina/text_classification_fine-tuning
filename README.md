# Fine-Tuning with LoRA

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning a model using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. The project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library alongside other essential packages to preprocess data, train a model, and perform inference. 

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizes `pandas` for handling input data and `scikit-learn` for dataset splitting and evaluation metrics.
- **Model Training**: Leverages the `transformers`, `peft`, and `trl` libraries to fine-tune a causal language model with LoRA configurations.
