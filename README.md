# Fine-Tuning with LoRA

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning a model using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) technique. The project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library alongside other essential packages to preprocess data, train a model, and perform inference.

## Training Details

- ## Model Initialization

Quantization is applied to optimize the model for efficient training. Quantization is a technique to reduce the computational and memory costs of running inference by representing the weights and activations with low-precision data type.

- ## LoRA Configuration

LoRA is a highly efficient training technique that reduces the number of trainable parameters by focusing on a small subset of parameters during training. This approach significantly accelerates the training process, decreases memory usage, and results in more compact model weights that are easier to store and share.

- ## Training Setup

The SFTTrainer class from the `trl` library is used to manage the training process.

- ## Model Merging

Fine-tuned parameters are merged with the base model to create the final model.

## Inference

Dataset examples will be provided later.
